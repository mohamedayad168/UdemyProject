      <!-- FAQ 1 -->
      <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">
        <h5 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-700">How do I decide what type of recording I'll need to do for my course?</h5>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Let your course content be your guide. Based on your content you should pick the video format that allows for the best visual accompaniment for your message. 
          If you're teaching coding or a technical course, you'll most likely record your screen while you talk (called "screencasting"). 
          If you don't need to show slides or a screen to demonstrate what you're teaching, "talking head" videos are typically most effective. 
          You may even want to show slides with an audio overlay, which is great when you need students to visualize complex concepts.
        </p>

      <!-- FAQ 2 -->
      <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">
        <h5 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-700">How much money do I need to spend on equipment?</h5>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
          This depends on what equipment you may already have and how much you'd like to invest. Most smartphones can capture excellent video. 
          You might consider using an external microphone as smartphone built-in microphones typically don't capture the best audio. 
          Check our recommendations to see what you already own and experiment with your setup before investing in new equipment.

      <!-- FAQ 3 -->
      <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">
        <h5 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-700">How does the test video process work?</h5>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Once your recording space is set up, you can submit a 5 minute test video to get personalized feedback on your recording quality. 
          Once your test video is received, our team will provide you with feedback on the quality of your audio, video, and display. 
          While this is not a requirement, it's highly recommended so that you can feel confident that your recording quality meets our standards. 
          If you change your recording setup at any time, you can submit another test video.
