      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-6">
        On Udemy, you have the potential to reach millions of students who are
        eager to learn. In order to get a head start and stand out from the
        competition, it’s important to drive some of your own success, as well.
      </p>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Step 1: Write your Course Landing Page.
          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            Whether students find your course through organic search, Udemy
            promotions, or through your own marketing efforts, they’ll
            eventually land on your
            <a href="#" class="text-purple-700 underline"
              >Course Landing Page (CLP)</a
            >. This is what students decide whether your course is worth
            enrolling in by reviewing your title, course description, preview
            lectures, and more.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Step 2: Pick a course price and join Udemy promotions.
          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            Your course can be free or paid (between $20–200). Prices outside of
            the US may be adapted to the local markets. You can also decide
            whether you want to opt in to
            <a href="#" class="text-purple-700 underline">Udemy Deals</a>, which
            will enable Udemy to manage your course price and help your content
            reach millions of learners worldwide.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Step 3: Build social proof.
          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            To gain momentum for your course once it’s first published, you’ll
            need to get social proof. This means earning a couple dozen (paid)
            enrollments and some honest reviews. To develop this social proof,
            share your courses with friends and family and with your social
            networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), or on other online forums
            related to your topic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Step 4: Expand to other channels and grow your audience.
          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            Once you have established yourself as an instructor on Udemy, think
            of ways to drive traffic from external sites to your courses. For
            example, you could use a blog, a YouTube channel, or a social media
            platform like LinkedIn or Instagram to expand your audience outside
            of Udemy and drive more awareness of your course.

            How does the revenue share work?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            When you drive learners to your course with an instructor coupon or
            a referral link, you earn 97% of the net revenue. When learners
            discover your course through Udemy — whether that’s an email they
            receive, an ad they click, a recommendation they see, or any other
            way — you earn 37%.

            What’s the earning potential of the typical instructor?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            This highly depends on your course topic and the size of your
            potential audience. Before you decide what to teach, research your
            topic using the
            <a href="#" class="text-purple-700 underline"
              >Marketplace Insights</a
            >
            tool. This helps you understand how many potential learners you can
            reach and how much competition there is.

        <div class="mb-6">
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">How will I get paid?</h3>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            Udemy pays instructors through PayPal, Payoneer, or direct deposit
            (US only). Payments from PayPal are delivered directly to your
            PayPal account, which can in turn be transferred to your bank
            account. Payoneer payments can be transferred to your local bank
            account or a prepaid MasterCard.

            How does Udemy market my course?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-sm mt-1">
            One of the biggest benefits of putting your course on Udemy is
            exposing your course to millions of learners worldwide. For courses
            that are opted into Udemy Deals, Udemy promotions drive tens of
            millions of paid enrollments each year. We invest in a wide variety
            of marketing channels to promote instructors’ content, including
            email marketing, paid ads, social media, and affiliates. The more a
            course stands out, the more we’re likely to feature it in our
            marketing. So to benefit from our marketing muscle, make sure that
            it stands out on its own first!
